# About me

## I'm Aurpon

Hello, I'm currently a software engineer at Classy Inc.. This account is just for me to mess around with my own ideas for projects and practice certain techniques/technologies. 
I want to be someone who can one day execute on his own big tech ideas from start to finish with the full understanding of how things work.
To whoever sees this: I hope you can enjoy my journey in learning to become a developer who can bring my ambitions to life.
